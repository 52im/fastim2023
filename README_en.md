## FastIM
> ðŸš€ Based on Netty's highly available distributed instant messaging system, it supports long-connected gateway management, single chat, group chat, login log-out, chat history query, offline message storage, message push, heartbeat, distributed unique ID,redpacket, message synchronization, and roaming, supporting the distributed architecture of cluster deployment.

## Project Structure
- fastim-logic:logical services such as single chat, group chat, red envelope, offline, and other business logic
- fastim-client:client logic implementation, enabling sending messages, disconnecting,SDK packages, and more
- fastim-gate-tcp:HTTP API gateway implementation for streaming downgrades, version routing,openAPI management, protocol conversion, generalization calls, and more
- fastim-gate-http:A long-connected TCP gateway implementation that enables custom protocols,channel management, heartbeat detection, generalization calls, and more
- fastim-leaf:Distributed ID implementation, zookeeper-based implementation or full memory-based implementation
- fastim-common:Common classes, mainly the storage of entity and tool classes
- fastim-lsb:LSB service,which provides access layer IP and port for load balancing connections
- fastim-das:Data access layer implementation, encapsulating one layer, providing an addition and deletion portal to the data
